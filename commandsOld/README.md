# ackcord-commands
This module contains the basis for the default AckCord command system. Note that you need some sort of implementation to use this. If you're using the in memory cache, then you want to depend on `ackcord-commands-core`, not this.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "net.katsstuff" %% "ackcord-commands" % "0.16.0"
```
